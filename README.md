# 📌 Project #2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Spotify Top 200 Charts (2020–2021)

## 🌟 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **Spotify Top 200 Weekly Global Charts** dataset for the years **2020 and 2021**. The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights about songs, artists, genres, and song features using **Python**, **Pandas**, and visualization libraries like **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.

Through this analysis, we aim to understand the characteristics of popular songs, explore correlations between features like **danceability, energy, and tempo**, and visualize key trends in the Spotify music dataset.
