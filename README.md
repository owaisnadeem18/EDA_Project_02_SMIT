# 📌 Project #2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Spotify Top 200 Charts (2020–2021)

## 🌟 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **Spotify Top 200 Weekly Global Charts** dataset for the years **2020 and 2021**. The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights about songs, artists, genres, and song features using **Python**, **Pandas**, and visualization libraries like **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.

Through this analysis, we aim to understand the characteristics of popular songs, explore correlations between features like **danceability, energy, and tempo**, and visualize key trends in the Spotify music dataset.

## 🗂 Dataset
- **Source:** [Spotify Top 200 Charts (2020–2021) by Sashank Pillai](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sashankpillai/spotify-top-200-charts-20202021)
- **Content:** The dataset includes all the songs that have been on the Top 200 Weekly (Global) charts of Spotify in 2020 & 2021. It contains features such as:
  - Song name
  - Artist
  - Genre
  - Popularity
  - Features like danceability, energy, tempo, etc.

## 📝 Project Objectives
- Perform **data cleaning**: handle missing values and duplicates
- Explore **song trends** based on genre, artist, and popularity
- Visualize **distributions** of song features
- Identify patterns and correlations between attributes

## 🎯 Assignment Questions (Spotify Songs EDA)

### Problem Statement:
In the age of digital music streaming, platforms like Spotify have revolutionized the way we listen to music. Analyzing streaming data can reveal valuable insights into listening habits, genre popularity, song features, and trends that define the music industry. In this project, we will explore Spotify’s track data to identify patterns, relationships between audio features and popularity, and the characteristics of top-charting songs.

### EDA Questions:
1. How many unique artists are in the dataset?
2. What is the distribution of song popularity scores?
3. Which artists appear most frequently in the Top 200?
4. What are the most common genres?
5. What is the average duration of songs?
6. How do audio features like danceability, energy, and valence vary across genres?
7. Which countries contribute the most to the top charts?

### Visualization Questions:
1. Bar chart of Top 10 artists by number of chart appearances.
2. Histogram of song popularity scores.
3. Boxplot showing distribution of danceability across genres.
4. Heatmap showing correlation between audio features (danceability, energy, valence, tempo, loudness).
5. Line chart showing trend of popularity over time.
6. Scatter plot of energy vs loudness colored by genre.
7. Pie chart showing percentage distribution of songs by explicit vs non-explicit lyrics.
